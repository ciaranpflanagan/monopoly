# The Odds Of Monopoly

A C program to calculate the odds of landing on any one of the 40 Monopoly squares or streets. This is based on the Irish version of Monopoly which includes some streets such as Grafton Street, O'Connel Street and others.

This was mainly done out of boredom and to practice programming in C. Enjoy!
